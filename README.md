# tz-geo-currency
A JavaScript library offering a privacy-friendly alternative to IP-based geolocation, using timezone information to infer a user's country and currency.

# Motivation
In 2024, services with potential global markets still face challenges in auto-detecting users' countries and currenciesâ€”key elements for payments and product displays. The Geolocation API, while capable of pinpointing a user's region, requires consent, making it an intrusive option for simple content localization. This underscores the necessity for a more nuanced method to determine user locales discreetly, respecting their privacy.

## Solving the Problem
Currency and country are typically closely related, as each country usually has its own official currency that forms a fundamental part of its economic identity. An effective method to deduce these attributes is by utilizing "timeZone" information, inspired by a [Stack Overflow comment](https://stackoverflow.com/a/65043902). Knowing a user's timezone offers a significant clue to their country, which, in turn, is often associated with a primary currency.

## Tradeoffs
Typically, the IP geolocation method is the standard approach for detecting a user's country and currency, leveraging databases that link IP addresses to physical locations for accurate localization.

Trade-offs between the timezone and IP geolocation methods:

- Privacy: Timezone detection offers a privacy-friendly alternative, not requiring IP data, whereas IP geolocation provides precise location info but may raise privacy concerns.
- Accuracy: IP geolocation leads in accuracy, directly correlating to the user's actual location. Timezone-based methods, while simpler, can be less precise due to timezones covering multiple countries.
- Cost-Effectiveness: Implementing timezone detection is generally more straightforward and cost-effective, avoiding the potential expenses associated with IP geolocation services.
